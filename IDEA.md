# Proof of Work Protocol
- The idea is to create a platform where a person keep track of all the work/tasks they have done for different DAOs.
- DAOs can use the protocol to create NFTs for the specific tasks and reward the same NFT to the one who completes the task.
- DAOs can also use the protocol as a task allocation mechanism based on track record of individuals.
- DAOs can gate individuals from applying for tasks based on certain criteria derived from this protocol.
- This is similar to POAP but for work/tasks.
